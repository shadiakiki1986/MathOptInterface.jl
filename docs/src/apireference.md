# API Reference

[Some introduction to API. List basic standalone methods.]

## Attributes

List of attribute categories.

```@docs
AbstractOptimizerAttribute
AbstractModelAttribute
AbstractVariableAttribute
AbstractConstraintAttribute
```

Attributes can be set in different ways:

* it is either set when the model is created like [`SolverName`](@ref) and
  [`RawSolver`](@ref),
* or explicitly when the model is copied like [`ObjectiveSense`](@ref),
* or implicitly, e.g., [`NumberOfVariables`](@ref) is implicitly set by
  [`add_variable`](@ref) and [`ConstraintFunction`](@ref) is implicitly set by
  [`add_constraint`](@ref).
* or it is set to contain the result of the optimization during
  [`optimize!`](@ref) like [`VariablePrimal`](@ref).

The following functions allow to distinguish between some of these different
categories:
```@docs
is_set_by_optimize
is_copyable
```

Functions for getting and setting attributes.

```@docs
get
get!
set
supports
```

### Fallbacks

The value of some attributes can be inferred from the value of other
attributes. For instance, the value of [`ObjectiveValue`](@ref) can be computed
using [`ObjectiveFunction`](@ref) and [`VariablePrimal`](@ref). When a solver
gives access to the objective value, it is better to return this value but
otherwise, [`Utilities.get_fallback`](@ref) can be used.
```julia
function MOI.get(optimizer::Optimizer, attr::MOI.ObjectiveValue)
    return MOI.Utilities.get_fallback(optimizer, attr)
end
```

```@docs
Utilities.get_fallback
```

### Submit

```

### Result Status

The `PrimalStatus` and `DualStatus` attributes indicate how to interpret the result returned by the solver.
The value of the attribute is of type `ResultStatusCode`.

```@docs
ResultStatusCode
```

## Variables and Constraints

### Basis Status

The `BasisStatus` attribute of a constraint describes its status with respect to
a basis, if one is known. The value of the attribute is of type
`BasisStatusCode`.

```@docs
BasisStatusCode
```

### Index types

```@docs
VariableIndex
ConstraintIndex
is_valid
throw_if_not_valid
delete(::ModelLike, ::Index)
delete(::ModelLike, ::Vector{<:Index})
```

### Variables

*Free variables* are the variables created with [`add_variable`](@ref) or
[`add_variables`](@ref) while *constrained variables* are
the variables created with [`add_constrained_variable`](@ref) or
[`add_constrained_variables`](@ref). Adding constrained variables instead of
constraining free variables with [`add_constraint`](@ref) allows
[variable bridges](@ref variable_bridges) to be used.
Note further that free variables that are constrained with
[`add_constraint`](@ref) may be copied by [`copy_to`](@ref) with
[`add_constrained_variable`](@ref) or [`add_constrained_variables`](@ref) by the
[`Utilities.CachingOptimizer`](@ref).
More precisely, the attributes do not distinguish constraints on variables
created with `add_constrained_variable(s)` or `add_variable(s)`/`add_constraint`.
When the model is copied, if a variable is constrained in several sets,
the implementation of [`copy_to`](@ref) can determine whether it is added
using [`add_variable`](@ref) or [`add_constrained_variable`](@ref) with one
of the sets. The rest of the constraints on the variables are added
with [`add_constraint`](@ref). For deleting, see [Index types](@ref).

```@docs

```

### Constraints

Functions for adding and modifying constraints.

```@docs
is_valid(::ModelLike,::ConstraintIndex)

```

List of attributes associated with constraints. [category AbstractConstraintAttribute]

Note that setting the [`ConstraintFunction`](@ref) of a [`SingleVariable`]
constraint is not allowed:

```

or vector sets.

```

### Matrix sets

Matrix sets are vectorized in order to be subtypes of
[`AbstractVectorSet`](@ref). For sets of symmetric matrices, storing both the
`(i, j)` and `(j, i)` elements is redundant so there exists the
[`AbstractSymmetricMatrixSetTriangle`](@ref) set to represent only the
vectorization of the upper triangular part of the matrix. When the matrix
of expressions constrained to be in the set is not symmetric and hence
the `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` elements should be constrained to be symmetric,
the [`AbstractSymmetricMatrixSetSquare`](@ref) set can be used. The
[`Bridges.Constraint.SquareBridge`](@ref) can transform a set from the square
form to the [`triangular_form`](@ref) by adding appropriate constraints if
the `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` expressions are different.

## Errors

When an MOI call fails on a model, precise errors should be thrown when possible
instead of simply calling `error` with a message. The docstrings for the
respective methods describe the errors that the implementation should thrown in
certain situations. This error-reporting system allows code to distinguish
between internal errors (that should be shown to the user) and unsupported
operations which may have automatic workarounds.

When an invalid index is used in an MOI call, an [`InvalidIndex`](@ref) should
be thrown:
```@docs
InvalidIndex
```

As discussed in [JuMP mapping](@ref), for scalar constraint with a nonzero
function constant, a [`ScalarFunctionConstantNotZero`](@ref) exception may be
thrown:
```@docs
ScalarFunctionConstantNotZero
```

Some [`SingleVariable`](@ref) constraints cannot be combined on the same
variable:
```@docs
LowerBoundAlreadySet
UpperBoundAlreadySet
```

As discussed in [`AbstractCallback`](@ref), trying to [`get`](@ref) attributes
inside a callback may throw:
```@docs
OptimizeInProgress
```

Trying to submit the wrong type of [`AbstractSubmittable`](@ref) inside an
[`AbstractCallback`](@ref) (e.g., a [`UserCut`](@ref) inside a
[`LazyConstraintCallback`](@ref)) will throw:
```@docs
InvalidCallbackUsage
```

The rest of the errors defined in MOI fall in two categories represented by the
following two abstract types:
```@docs
UnsupportedError
NotAllowedError
```

The different [`UnsupportedError`](@ref) and [`NotAllowedError`](@ref) are the
following errors:
```@docs
UnsupportedAttribute
SetAttributeNotAllowed
AddVariableNotAllowed
UnsupportedConstraint
AddConstraintNotAllowed
ModifyConstraintNotAllowed
ModifyObjectiveNotAllowed
DeleteNotAllowed
UnsupportedSubmittable
SubmitNotAllowed
```

## Models

[`Utilities.Model`](@ref) provides an implementation of a [`ModelLike`](@ref)
that efficiently supports all functions and sets defined within MOI. However,
given the extensibility of MOI, this might not over all use cases.

[`Utilities.UniversalFallback`](@ref) is a layer that sits on top of any
`ModelLike` and provides non-specialized (slower) fallbacks for constraints and
attributes that the underlying `ModeLike` does not support.

For advanced use cases that need efficient support for functions and sets
defined outside of MOI (but still known at compile time), we provide the
[`Utilities.@model`](@ref) macro.

```@docs
Utilities.Model
Utilities.UniversalFallback
Utilities.@model
```

## Bridges

Bridges can be used for automatic reformulation of constrained variables (i.e.
variables added with [`add_constrained_variable`](@ref)/[`add_constrained_variables`](@ref))
or constraints into equivalent formulations using constrained variables and
constraints of different types. There are two important concepts to distinguish:
* [`Bridges.AbstractBridge`](@ref)s are recipes implementing a specific
  reformulation. Bridges are not directly subtypes of
  [`Bridges.AbstractBridge`](@ref), they are either
  [`Bridges.Variable.AbstractBridge`](@ref) or
  [`Bridges.Constraint.AbstractBridge`](@ref).
* [`Bridges.AbstractBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) is a layer that can be applied to
  another [`ModelLike`](@ref) to apply the reformulation. The
  [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) automatically chooses the appropriate
  bridges to use when a constrained variable or constraint is not supported
  by using the list of bridges that were added to it by
  [`Bridges.add_bridge`](@ref). [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref) wraps a
  model in a [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) where all the bridges defined
  in MOI are added. This is the recommended way to use bridges in the
  [Testing guideline](@ref), and JuMP automatically calls
  [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref) when attaching an optimizer.
  [`Bridges.debug_supports_constraint`](@ref) and [`Bridges.debug_supports`](@ref)
  allow introspection into the bridge selection rationale of
  [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref).

Most bridges are added by default in [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref).
However, for technical reasons, some bridges are not added by default, for instance:
[`Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoPSDBridge`](@ref), [`Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge`](@ref)
and [`Bridges.Constraint.RSOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge`](@ref). See the docs of those bridges
for more information.

It is possible to add those bridges and also user defined bridges,
following one of the two methods. We present the examples for:
[`Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge`](@ref).

The first option is to add the specific bridges to a
`bridged_model` optimizer, with coefficient type `T`. The `bridged_model`
optimizer itself must have been constructed with a
[`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref). Once such a optimizer is available, we
can proceed using using [`Bridges.add_bridge`](@ref):

```julia
MOIB.add_bridge(bridged_model, SOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge{T})
```

Alternatively, it is possible to create a [`Bridges.Constraint.SingleBridgeOptimizer`](@ref)
and wrap an existing `model` with it:

```julia
const SOCtoNonConvexQuad{T, OT<:ModelLike} = Bridges.Constraint.SingleBridgeOptimizer{Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge{T}, OT}
bridged_model = SOCtoNonConvexQuad{Float64}(model)
```

Those procedures could be applied to user define bridges. For the
bridges defined in MathOptInterface, the [`Bridges.Constraint.SingleBridgeOptimizer`](@ref)'s are already created, therefore, for the case of [`Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge`](@ref), one could simply use the existing optimizer:

```julia
bridged_model = Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoNonConvexQuad{Float64}(model)
```

```@docs
Bridges.AbstractBridge
Bridges.AbstractBridgeOptimizer
Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer
Bridges.add_bridge
Bridges.remove_bridge
Bridges.has_bridge
Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer
Bridges.debug_supports_constraint
Bridges.debug_supports
```

### [Variable bridges](@id variable_bridges)

When variables are added, either free with
[`add_variable`](@ref)/[`add_variables`](@ref),
or constrained with
[`add_constrained_variable`](@ref)/[`add_constrained_variables`](@ref),
variable bridges allow to return *bridged variables* that do not correspond to
variables of the underlying model. These variables are parametrized by
variables of the underlying model and this parametrization can be obtained with
[`Bridges.bridged_variable_function`](@ref). Similarly, the variables of the
underlying model that were created by the bridge can be expressed in terms of
the bridged variables and this expression can be obtained with
[`Bridges.unbridged_variable_function`](@ref).
For instance, consider a model bridged by the
[`Bridges.Variable.VectorizeBridge`](@ref):
```jldoctest bridged_variable_function
model = MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()
bridged_model = MOI.Bridges.Variable.Vectorize{Float64}(model)
bridged_variable, bridged_constraint = MOI.add_constrained_variable(bridged_model, MOI.GreaterThan(1.0))

# output

(VariableIndex(-1), MOI.ConstraintIndex{MOI.SingleVariable,MOI.GreaterThan{Float64}}(-1))
```
The constrained variable in `MOI.GreaterThan(1.0)` returned is a bridged
variable as its index in negative. In `model`, a constrained variable in
`MOI.Nonnegatives` is created:
```jldoctest bridged_variable_function
inner_variables = MOI.get(model, MOI.ListOfVariableIndices())

# output

1-element Array{VariableIndex,1}:
 VariableIndex(1)
```
In the functions used for adding constraints or setting the objective to
`bridged_model`, `bridged_variable` is substituted for `inner_variables[1]` plus
1:
```jldoctest bridged_variable_function
MOI.Bridges.bridged_variable_function(bridged_model, bridged_variable)

# output

MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}(MOI.ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}[ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}(1.0, VariableIndex(1))], 1.0)
```
When getting [`ConstraintFunction`](@ref) or [`ObjectiveFunction`](@ref),
`inner_variables[1]` is substituted for `bridged_variable` minus 1:
```jldoctest bridged_variable_function
MOI.Bridges.unbridged_variable_function(bridged_model, inner_variables[1])

# output

MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}(MOI.ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}[ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}(1.0, VariableIndex(-1))], -1.0)
```

!!! note
    A notable exception is with [`Bridges.Variable.ZerosBridge`](@ref) where no
    variable is created in the underlying model as the variables are simply
    transformed to zeros. When this bridge is used, it is not possible to
    recover functions with bridged variables from functions of the inner
    model. Consider for instance that we create two zero variables:
    ```jldoctest cannot_unbridge_zero
    model = MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()
    bridged_model = MOI.Bridges.Variable.Zeros{Float64}(model)
    bridged_variables, bridged_constraint = MOI.add_constrained_variables(bridged_model, MOI.Zeros(2))

    # output

    (MOI.VariableIndex[VariableIndex(-1), VariableIndex(-2)], MOI.ConstraintIndex{MOI.VectorOfVariables,MOI.Zeros}(-1))
    ```
    Consider the following functions in the variables of `bridged_model`:
    ```jldoctest cannot_unbridge_zero
    func = MOI.Utilities.operate(+, Float64, MOI.SingleVariable.(bridged_variables)...)

    # output

    MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}(MOI.ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}[ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}(1.0, VariableIndex(-1)), ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}(1.0, VariableIndex(-2))], 0.0)
    ```
    We can obtain the equivalent function in the variables of `model` as follows:
    ```jldoctest cannot_unbridge_zero
    inner_func = MOI.Bridges.bridged_function(bridged_model, func)

    # output

    MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}(MOI.ScalarAffineTerm{Float64}[], 0.0)
    ```
    However, it's not possible to invert this operation. Indeed, since the
    bridged variables are substituted for zeros, we cannot deduce whether
    they were present in the initial function.
    ```jldoctest cannot_unbridge_zero; filter = r"Stacktrace:.*"s
    MOI.Bridges.unbridged_function(bridged_model, inner_func)

    # output

    ERROR: Cannot unbridge function because some variables are bridged by variable bridges that do not support reverse mapping, e.g., `ZerosBridge`.
    Stacktrace:

Bridges.Variable.RSOCtoSOCBridge

```

For each bridge defined in this package, a corresponding
[`Bridges.Variable.SingleBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) is available with the same
name without the "Bridge" suffix, e.g., `SplitInterval` is a
`SingleBridgeOptimizer` for the `SplitIntervalBridge`. Moreover, they are all
added in the [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) returned by
[`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref) as it calls
[`Bridges.Variable.add_all_bridges`](@ref).
```@docs
Bridges.Variable.SingleBridgeOptimizer
Bridges.Variable.add_all_bridges
```

### Constraint bridges

When constraints are added with [`add_constraint`](@ref), constraint bridges
allow to return *bridged constraints* that do not correspond to
constraints of the underlying model. These constraints were enforced by an
equivalent formulation that added constraints (and possibly also variables) in
the underlying model.
For instance, consider a model bridged by the
[`Bridges.Constraint.SplitIntervalBridge`](@ref):
```jldoctest split_interval
model = MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()
bridged_model = MOI.Bridges.Constraint.SplitInterval{Float64}(model)
x, y = MOI.add_variables(bridged_model, 2)
func = MOI.Utilities.operate(+, Float64, MOI.SingleVariable(x), MOI.SingleVariable(y))
c = MOI.add_constraint(bridged_model, func, MOI.Interval(1.0, 2.0))

# output

MOI.ConstraintIndex{MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MOI.Interval{Float64}}(1)
```
We can see the constraint was bridged to two constraints, one for each bound,
in the inner model.
```jldoctest split_interval
MOI.get(model, MOI.ListOfConstraints())

# output

2-element Array{Tuple{DataType,DataType},1}:
 (MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}, MOI.GreaterThan{Float64})
 (MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}, MOI.LessThan{Float64})
```
However, `bridged_model` transparently hides these constraints and creates the
illusion that an interval constraint was created.
```jldoctest split_interval
MOI.get(bridged_model, MOI.ListOfConstraints())

# output

1-element Array{Tuple{DataType,DataType},1}:
 (MOI.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}, MOI.Interval{Float64})
```
It is nevertheless possible to differentiate this constraint from a constraint
added to the inner model by asking whether it is bridged:
```jldoctest split_interval
MOI.Bridges.is_bridged(bridged_model, c)

# output

true
```

```@docs

Below is the list of constraint bridges implemented in this package.

Bridges.Constraint.SemiToBinaryBridge
Bridges.Constraint.ZeroOneBridge
```
For each bridge defined in this package, a corresponding
[`Bridges.Constraint.SingleBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) is available with the same
name without the "Bridge" suffix, e.g., `SplitInterval` is a
`SingleBridgeOptimizer` for the `SplitIntervalBridge`. Moreover, they are all
added in the [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) returned by
[`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref) as it calls
[`Bridges.Constraint.add_all_bridges`](@ref).
```@docs
Bridges.Constraint.SingleBridgeOptimizer
Bridges.Constraint.add_all_bridges
```

### Objective bridges

When an objective is set with [`set`](@ref), objective bridges
allow to set a *bridged objective* to the underlying model that do not
correspond to the objective set by the user. This equivalent formulation may add
constraints (and possibly also variables) in the underlying model in addition
to setting an objective function.

```@docs
Bridges.Objective.AbstractBridge
```

Below is the list of objective bridges implemented in this package.
```@docs
Bridges.Objective.SlackBridge
Bridges.Objective.FunctionizeBridge
```
For each bridge defined in this package, a corresponding
[`Bridges.Objective.SingleBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) is available with the same
name without the "Bridge" suffix, e.g., `Slack` is a `SingleBridgeOptimizer`
for the `SlackBridge`. Moreover, they are all added in the
[`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref) returned by
[`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref) as it calls
[`Bridges.Objective.add_all_bridges`](@ref).
```@docs
Bridges.Objective.SingleBridgeOptimizer
Bridges.Objective.add_all_bridges
```

### Bridge interface

A bridge should implement the following functions to be usable by a bridge optimizer:
```@docs
Bridges.added_constrained_variable_types
Bridges.added_constraint_types
```
Additionally, variable bridges should implement:
```@docs
Bridges.Variable.supports_constrained_variable
Bridges.Variable.concrete_bridge_type
Bridges.Variable.bridge_constrained_variable
```
constraint bridges should implement:
```@docs
supports_constraint(::Type{<:Bridges.Constraint.AbstractBridge}, ::Type{<:AbstractFunction}, ::Type{<:AbstractSet})
Bridges.Constraint.concrete_bridge_type
Bridges.Constraint.bridge_constraint
```
and objective bridges should implement:
```@docs
Bridges.set_objective_function_type
Bridges.Objective.concrete_bridge_type
Bridges.Objective.bridge_objective
```

When querying the [`NumberOfVariables`](@ref), [`NumberOfConstraints`](@ref)
and [`ListOfConstraintIndices`](@ref), the variables and constraints created
by the bridges in the underlying model are hidden by the bridge optimizer.
For this purpose, the bridge should provide access to the variables and
constraints it has creates by implemented the following methods of
[`get`](@ref):
```@docs
get(::Bridges.Constraint.AbstractBridge, ::NumberOfVariables)
get(::Bridges.Constraint.AbstractBridge, ::ListOfVariableIndices)
get(::Bridges.AbstractBridge, ::NumberOfConstraints)
get(::Bridges.AbstractBridge, ::ListOfConstraintIndices)
```

## Copy utilities

The following utilities can be used to implement [`copy_to`](@ref). See
[Implementing copy](@ref) for more details.

```@docs
Utilities.automatic_copy_to
Utilities.default_copy_to
Utilities.supports_default_copy_to
```

### Allocate-Load API

The Allocate-Load API allows solvers that do not support loading the problem
incrementally to implement [`copy_to`](@ref) in a way that still allows
transformations to be applied in the copy between the cache and the
model if the transformations are implemented as MOI layers implementing the
Allocate-Load API, see [Implementing copy](@ref) for more details.

Loading a model using the Allocate-Load interface consists of two passes
through the model data:
1) the allocate pass where the model typically records the necessary information
   about the constraints and attributes such as their number and size.
   This information may be used by the solver to allocate datastructures of
   appropriate size.
2) the load pass where the model typically loads the constraint and attribute
   data to the model.

The description above only gives a suggestion of what to achieve in each pass.
In fact the exact same constraint and attribute data is provided to each pass,
so an implementation of the Allocate-Load API is free to do whatever is more
convenient in each pass.

The main difference between each pass, apart from the fact that one is executed
before the other during a copy, is that the allocate pass needs to create and
return new variable and constraint indices, while during the load pass the
appropriate constraint indices are provided.

The Allocate-Load API is **not** meant to be used outside a copy operation,
that is, the interface is not meant to be used to create new constraints with
[`Utilities.allocate_constraint`](@ref) followed by
[`Utilities.load_constraint`](@ref) after a solve.
This means that the order in which the different functions of the API are
called is fixed by [`Utilities.allocate_load`](@ref) and models implementing the
API can rely on the fact that functions will be called in this order. That is,
it can be assumed that the different functions will the called in the following
order:
1) [`Utilities.allocate_variables`](@ref)
2) [`Utilities.allocate`](@ref) and [`Utilities.allocate_constraint`](@ref)
3) [`Utilities.load_variables`](@ref)
4) [`Utilities.load`](@ref) and [`Utilities.load_constraint`](@ref)

### Caching optimizer

Some solvers do not support incremental definition of optimization
models. Nevertheless, you are still able to build incrementally an optimization
model with such solvers. MathOptInterface provides a utility,
[`Utilities.CachingOptimizer`](@ref), that will store in a [`ModelLike`](@ref)
the optimization model during its incremental definition. Once the
model is completely defined, the `CachingOptimizer` specifies all problem
information to the underlying solver, all at once.

The function [`Utilities.state`](@ref) allows to query the state
of the optimizer cached inside a `CachingOptimizer`. The state
could be:
* `NO_OPTIMIZER`, if no optimizer is attached;
* `EMPTY_OPTIMIZER`, if the attached optimizer is empty;
* `ATTACHED_OPTIMIZER`, if the attached optimizer is synchronized with the
  cached model defined in `CachingOptimizer`.

The following methods modify the state of the attached optimizer:
* [`Utilities.attach_optimizer`](@ref) attachs a new `optimizer`
  to a `cached_optimizer` with state `EMPTY_OPTIMIZER`.
  The state of `cached_optimizer` is set to `ATTACHED_OPTIMIZER` after the call.
* [`Utilities.drop_optimizer`](@ref) drops the underlying `optimizer`
  from `cached_optimizer`, without emptying it. The state of `cached_optimizer`
  is set to `NO_OPTIMIZER` after the call.
* [`Utilities.reset_optimizer`](@ref) empties `optimizer` inside
  `cached_optimizer`, without droping it. The state of `cached_optimizer`
  is set to `EMPTY_OPTIMIZER` after the call.

The way to operate a `CachingOptimizer` depends whether the mode
is set to `AUTOMATIC` or to `MANUAL`.
* In `MANUAL` mode, the state of the `CachingOptimizer` changes only
  if the methods [`Utilities.attach_optimizer`](@ref),
  [`Utilities.reset_optimizer`](@ref) or [`Utilities.drop_optimizer`](@ref)
  are being called. Any unattended operation results in an error.
* In `AUTOMATIC` mode, the state of the `CachingOptimizer` changes when
  necessary. Any modification not supported by the solver (e.g. dropping
  a constraint) results in a drop to the state `EMPTY_OPTIMIZER`.

When calling [`Utilities.attach_optimizer`](@ref), the `CachingOptimizer` copies
the cached model to the optimizer with [`copy_to`](@ref).
